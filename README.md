# Lawyer Finding System
In our country many people are facing problems of finding legal advice from legal advisor or lawyer. Considering these problems, I want to implement the “lawyer finding system” which will reduce the problem of people. Lawyers can get registered into this system with their information. Normal user can search for any type of legal question.  Lawyer can give answers to these questions. User can send appointment request to the lawyers. If the lawyers accept the request then user can get the personal information of that lawyer and communicate with the lawyer.
